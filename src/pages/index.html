			<p>Based in Edgewater, Florida, Everglades is a manufacturer of premium, offshore fishing boats. Founded in 1997 by industry legend, inventor and visionary, Bob Dougherty, Everglades is known for its innovative approach to boat-building and has established a ‘cult-like’ following among its customers. Its patented hull design process ensures unsinkability, durability and, in our opinion, the most superior ride in the industry.</p>
			<p>We partnered with Everglades’ experienced management team as the company enters its next phase of growth. With fresh capital, the Company is accelerating product development and geographic expansion, while continuing to bring cutting-edge innovation to the market.</p>

			<p>Kona Deep is a new type of functional bottled water — deep ocean water. Sourced 3,000 feet below Kona, Hawaii, the water is full of naturally-occurring ocean electrolytes. It hydrates more effectively than sports drinks yet has the purity and taste of spring water. Kona Deep can be found in retailers and resorts throughout Hawaii including Whole Foods, 7-Eleven and Safeway, and on the U.S. Mainland at Sprouts, Kroger, Gelson’s and Amazon, among others.</p>
			<p>We were inspired by the unique water source that produces an all-natural, better-for-you product with absolutely nothing added. We partnered with a highly experienced management team led by Pat Turpin, the co-founder and former President of popchips, to bring this new category of premium bottled water to market.</p>

			<p>Outlaw Energy is a branded energy drink business with a classic old west image geared for values-driven, outdoor enthusiasts who live with an ‘Outlaw state of mind’. Its product line includes Original, Passion and Fruit Punch flavors as well as Citrus Zero and Fresh Zero, its no calorie / no sugar flavors. Packed with Ginseng, Guarana, Taurine and B Vitamins, Outlaw provides a powerful functional benefit to consumers and is currently sold at a number of convenience stores throughout the western U.S. and Mexico, including 7-Eleven, Circle K and Smart & Final.</p>
			<p>We were inspired by the success of founders Doug Weekes and Lance Collins, both of whom boast strong track records of success in the beverage industry. Given distribution dynamics, we felt Outlaw was entering the market at an ideal time to grow its brand across an already expanding energy drink category.</p>

Victor’s talents reach deep and also include a licensed home goods collection. Victor’s products are sold at specialty stores and high-end department stores globally including Barneys, Lane Crawford and Nordstrom.</p>
